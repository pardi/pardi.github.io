My optimisation improved the overall system speed of 100% and required a drastic change of the interfaces for coping with the increased throughput. However, the resulting increase in speed allowed more low-latency communication and utilisation of the devices by the user. In parallel to to my effort on the firmware side, I have been developing controller for multiple degrees of freedom arms.",
